# project-2-jym2584

## React Components used:
- react-router-dom
    - Got this from npm. I think navigation is pretty powerful in being able to display various components separately such as people, employment, etc.
- react-material-ui-carousel
    - Got this from npm. I used this for one of my course projects (SWEN-343) and I really liked this component. I was able to make this different by having text slide on the employment page
- react-map-gl
    - Used for the employment page to aggregate geolocation data and mapping it out with a list of employers based on the city
